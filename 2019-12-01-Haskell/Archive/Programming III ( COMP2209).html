<h2>Coursework Two</h2>

<p>
The instructions for the coursework are provided in the</p>

<p><a href="https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp2209/19-20/CW2/Assignment2.pdf">Instruction sheet</a></p>

<p>
Notes from Andy Gravell's lecture in support of the coursework</p>

<p><a href="https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp2209/19-20/CW2/comp2209HaskellCodingAndTesting2019.pptx">comp2209HaskellCodingAndTesting2019.pptx</a>
</p>

<p>
You will also need to download the Haskell file</p>
<p><a href="https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp2209/19-20/CW2/Challenges.hs">Challenges.hs</a></p>
<p>
that contains the function signatures and dummy implementations as well as downloading the Haskell</p>

<p><a href="https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp2209/19-20/CW2/Challenges2019tests.hs">Test Harness</a></p>

<p>
that we will use to run our automated tests for marking and feedback.  
Feel free to add more of your own tests to this file.  You will notice 
that the tests rely upon checking equality between the result of 
executing your solution to the challenges and some fixed expected 
result.  Where there may be some variability in results, appropriate 
notions of equivalence will be defined to perform this check. These are 
not reflected in the Test Harness file above. You are free to vary the 
equality checks in your testing code as you see fit.
</p>

<p>
We have provided the file <a href="https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp2209/19-20/CW2/Parsing.hs">Parsing.hs</a>
 that contains many of the useful functions from Chapter 13 on Monadic 
Parsing in Hutton's book. You will need to download this file to compile
 the Challenges.hs file.
</p>

<p>
At the lecture on Tuesday (5pm, 12th Nov 67/1037), Andy Gravell will 
answer any questions you may have about the assessment process or the 
functions required in the instructions themselves.
</p>

<p>Please read the instructions before then and come along if anything is unclear.</p>
